# 🌟 TaskFlow – Responsive Landing Page

A beautifully crafted, fully responsive landing page built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **ShadCN UI**.  
Designed to provide a modern SaaS-style experience with pricing plans, authentication pages, checkout flow, and demo preview support.
I used Vercel v0 to generate the UI for the Hero section, Features layout, 
Testimonials cards, and Pricing layout. These components were refined and 
cleaned for readability and responsiveness using Tailwind CSS. The project was 
built in Next.js (App Router) with a modular component structure. The landing 
page is fully responsive and deployed on Vercel with optimized performance.
